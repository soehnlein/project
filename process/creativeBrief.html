    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <h3>Cal Choices: Bringing Design and Usability to the Advance Healthcare Planning Process</h3>
    <p>Making advance healthcare decisions, such as choosing a healthcare proxy, is important to do while a person
      can still speak for him or herself. Conversations about and written records of these decisions may alleviate suffering
      for both the person making the decisions, as well as his or her healthcare team, family and friends. Unfortunately, many
      existing resources regarding advance healthcare planning suffer from poor visual design and a number of usability
      issues, including a lack of structure, poor adherence to accessibility standards, and use of overly technical language.
      Cal Choices is an interactive tablet application that aims to address usability issues in existing advance healthcare
      planning resources. The goal of Cal Choices is to introduce and guide Californians through the advance healthcare planning
      process in a friendly, accessible way. By completing a series of interactive activities, users gain an overall understanding
      of advance healthcare planning, are educated so they can make more informed decisions, and learn how to communicate their decisions
      in strategic ways. The content and presentation strategies in Cal Choices were developed in collaboration with the Betty Irene Moore
      School of Nursing and the Woodland Clinic palliative care team. The visual design of Cal Choices was developed following the World Wide
      Web Consortium (W3C) accessibility standards. Research regarding the usability (navigation, organization, language) of the application will
      be completed in spring 2016 via remote user testing.</p><br>
